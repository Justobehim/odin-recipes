        <h4>Preparing Cozonac</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
            <li>Give your kids something to stir or bang on harmlessly.</li>
            <li>Warm the milk along with the sugar and the vanilla bean seeds, adding the entire vanilla bean to the milk as well. The milk should just be warm when you try it with your finger, not hot!</li>
            <li>Use a fork to dissolve the fresh yeast with 3-4 tablespoons of the warm milk.</li>
            <li>Sift the flour 3 times. This is an important step, so don't skip it.</li>
            <li>(Optional)Go to the restroom quickly while telling your munchkins to wait for you quietly without breaking anything.</li>
            <li>Return to the kitchen to a re-enacted scene of world war II, with flour and eggs used as chemical weapons and artillery.</li>
            <li>Clean up mess.</li>
            <li>Go the the bakery shop and buy a nice, big cozonac.</li>
            <li>Try again next year.</li>
        </ol>
