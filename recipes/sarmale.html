        <h3>The traditional east-european dish sarmale</h3>
        <p>This recipe for Romanian stuffed cabbage, or sarmale, features ground pork, sauerkraut, tomatoes, and dill.

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 whole head cabbage, about 4 pounds</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tablespoons raw rice</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons hot water</li>
            <li>11/2 pounds finely chopped fresh dill</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon crushed red pepper, optional</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Prepare the Cabbage</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li> 
            <li>Remove the core from the cabbage. Place the whole head in a large pot filled with boiling, salted water. Cover and cook for 3 minutes, or until softened enough to pull off individual leaves. Drain. You will need about 20 leaves.</li>
            <li>When the leaves are cool enough to handle, use a paring knife to cut away the thick center stem from each leaf without cutting all the way through. Chop any remaining cabbage and set aside to be used in the Dutch oven.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, add 1 tablespoon of oil. Saut√© the chopped onion, garlic, and rice, stirring frequently, until the onion is translucent.</li>
            <li>Add 1/4 cup hot water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat, cover, and let stand 5 minutes or until the rice has absorbed all the water. Let cool.</li>
            <li>Place the pork in a large bowl. Quickly dip the bread in water, squeeze to remove excess water, and add to the meat.</li>
            <li>Add the cooled onion-garlic-rice mixture and mix. Add the dill, thyme, salt, black pepper, optional red pepper, and the remaining 2 tablespoons of water. Mix completely but lightly so as not to toughen the meat.</li>
            <li>Prepare the cooking liquid in a medium bowl by mixing 3 cups of water with the sauerkraut juice, Vegeta, peppercorns, and bay leaves, and set aside.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Assemble the Rolls and Bake</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place about 1/2 cup of meat mixture on each cabbage leaf. Flip the right side of the leaf to the middle, then flip the left side to the middle. You will have something that looks like an envelope.</li>
            <li>Roll away from you to encase the meat and create a neat little roll. Repeat with the remaining mixture.</li>
            <li>Using 2 tablespoons of the remaining olive oil, coat a large, lidded Dutch oven or casserole dish. Mix the reserved chopped cabbage with sauerkraut and place some in the bottom of the prepared Dutch oven.</li>
            <li>Place 3 strips of bacon across the sauerkraut and cover with a layer of stuffed cabbages.</li>
            <li>Add another layer of sauerkraut, bacon strips, and stuffed cabbage. Then top with remaining sauerkraut.</li>
            <li>Spread dill sprigs on top and sprinkle with the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil. Pour sauerkraut juice-water mixture overall.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 F. Place the Dutch oven over high heat on the stovetop and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer to the oven and cook 1 1/2 hours. Then add sliced tomatoes, cover, and cook another 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the lid and continue cooking another 15 minutes. Let cool for a few minutes. Remove the bay leaves and serve.</li>
        </ol>
